# TMC2209 UART

**Overview**: An efficient and versatile library designed for UART interfacing with the TMC2209 stepper motor driver. Crafted to ensure high performance and reliability when working with TMC2209 when interacting with STM32.

**Key Features**:

- Multi-level Abstraction:
	- Direct register access
	- High-level command interface
- CRC validation during reads and writes;
- Accelerated CRC computations using precalculated CRC values.


**TODO:**

- CRC calculation optimization for STM32 using CRC calculation unit;
- Enhanced UART performance for STM32:
	- Hardware UART peripheral
- Software UART support
- Usage examples
- Arduino library
